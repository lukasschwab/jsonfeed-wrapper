# jsonfeed-proxy

`main.py` is a generic Bottle util for serving a JSON Feed munged from another site's HTML. Hopefully this can reduce some logic

`user.py` is a clone of `itsnicethat-feed` using the new utils, just as a proof of concept/way for me to mess around with the interfaces.

## To do

+ Better documentation
+ Favicon support
+ Refactor `atlas-feed`, `itsnicethat-feed` to use this.
